/* This is a typical query that I run quite often. 
APE1_ACCUMULATORS is a table that contains some generically named fields
ADJ1_ID_MAPPING table has column names to match the generic names in APE1_RATED_EVENT
This query will pull the data from APE1_ACCUMULATORS table, and if there is a record in the ADJ1_ID_MAPPING table that matches the accum_type_id
, then it will print the data from ADJ1_ID_MAPPING also.

Specifically, I'm joining with ADJ1_ID_MAPPING because I want the ENTITY_NAME field, and I'm using the ACCUM_TYPE_ID to get it.
@PUSG_99 is a DB syn so that I can access the APE1_ACCUMULATOR table which resides on a different DB User/Instance.
