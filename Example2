/* The below example is from a script I wrote that will insert entries into a target table based on input from a temp table.
When the insert is done, I expect to see distinct entries in AUH1_REQUESTS for all the customers found in the TC_USG_IMPACT table.

TC_usg_impact is the source table which has a list of customers
The insert statement contains the colums that must be populated in AUH1_REQUESTS.
If I have more than one record for the same customer in the temp table, I only want to put one entry in the target table
Some of the values in the INSERT are coming from the input table(Customer id, cycle code) some are hard-coded(Application ID) and some are generated (SYSDATE)
I am using the CASE statement to checking the bill cycle against the sysdate in order to determine what month to use for my insert.
I could probably also use a CASE statement for the determining the year, but it's not really required for how this script is used.

SQLMODEC is defined earlier in the script as COMMIT or ROLLBACK, depending on the environment.
APPDBLINK is defined earlier in the script to allow me to access a table on another db instance that does not have a db link
